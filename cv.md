# **About myself**
My name is Kirill, I am 19 yers old and study to be a marketing specialist at the university. But I feel that it isn't what I want, so that I decide to learn coding. I should write more about myself, however idk who l really am. My biggest trouble is that I'm not disciplined and so lazy. To be honest it is my second try to start this course. So l wanna just overcome myself and start to dive into IT.
